Installation instructions for Vuurmuur
======================================

Unpack the installer package with:
gzip -cd Vuurmuur-0.8rc2.tar.gz | tar -xvf -

After this run install.sh like this:
'sh install.sh --install' for a new installation.
'sh install.sh --upgrade' for upgrading an installation.

During the installation you will be asked a number of questions. Pressing <enter>
will select the default. This is recommended. The default value is printed between
the braces after the question. If you are sure you want to select all the default
options you can run the installer like this:
'sh install.sh --install --defaults'

This will install Vuurmuur into '/usr' (/usr/bin, /usr/lib, /usr/include, /usr/share/vuurmuur)
and will use '/etc/vuurmuur' as configdir and '/var/log/vuurmuur' as logdir.

New (versions of) services will be installed in the services map in $PREFIX/share/vuurmuur.
Please copy them to your services map if you need them.

If anything goes wrong see the install.log. It will (hopefully) contain pointers
to what went wrong. Please contact me at victor@vuurmuur.org if you run into trouble.


TROUBLESHOOTING:

- If building vuurmuur_conf fails with a message of an missing macro AM_GNU_GETTEXT, then
  make sure gettext is installed.
